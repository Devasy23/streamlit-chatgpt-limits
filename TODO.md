To enhance the modularity of your Streamlit app and to accommodate additional operations like editing and deleting bookings, as well as enforcing booking slot constraints (e.g., bookings must be in multiples of 3 hours), you can further refine your codebase. Here's how you might approach these enhancements:

### Modular Design Considerations

1. **Split Functionality into More Specific Modules**: Break down `db.py` into more specific modules, such as `user_management.py` for handling user-related database operations and `booking_management.py` for booking-related operations. This separation makes the codebase easier to navigate and scale.

2. **Service Layer**: Introduce a service layer that sits between the Streamlit frontend (`app.py`) and the database operations (e.g., `user_management.py`, `booking_management.py`). This layer can handle business logic, such as the validation of booking times.

3. **Utilize Classes**: For both users and bookings, consider using classes to represent these entities. This approach can make handling data and related operations more intuitive.

### Proposed Structure with Enhancements

Here's an outline of how the updated project structure might look:

```
streamlit-chatgpt-limits/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── db/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── connection.py
│   ├── user_management.py
│   └── booking_management.py
├── services/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── booking_service.py
│   └── user_service.py
└── utils/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── helpers.py
```

- `connection.py`: Manages the MongoDB client connection.
- `user_management.py` and `booking_management.py`: Contain functions for user and booking CRUD operations, respectively.
- `booking_service.py` and `user_service.py`: Implement business logic, such as booking slot validation and user authentication.
- `helpers.py`: Includes utility functions like formatting messages or data for the UI.

### Implementing New Features

1. **Booking Slot Validation**: In `booking_service.py`, implement a function to check if a booking request meets the 3-hour multiple requirement.

    ```python
    def is_valid_booking(start, end):
        duration = end - start
        return duration.total_seconds() % (3 * 3600) == 0
    ```

2. **Edit and Delete Bookings**: In `booking_management.py`, add functions to update and remove bookings. These operations can then be called from the service layer or directly from `app.py`, depending on your design.

    ```python
    def update_booking(booking_id, new_start, new_end):
        # Implement booking update logic

    def delete_booking(booking_id):
        # Implement booking deletion logic
    ```

3. **UI for Additional Operations**: Extend `app.py` to include UI elements and logic for editing and deleting bookings, as well as displaying warnings when booking attempts violate the 3-hour rule.

### Additional Suggestions

- **Use Environment Variables**: For MongoDB connection strings and other sensitive information, use environment variables to enhance security.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling throughout the application to manage database errors, input validation failures, etc.
- **Testing**: Develop unit tests for the service layer to ensure business logic is correctly implemented, especially for critical functions like `is_valid_booking`.

By adopting these modular design principles and implementing the suggested features, your Streamlit app will be well-positioned for further development and maintenance.
